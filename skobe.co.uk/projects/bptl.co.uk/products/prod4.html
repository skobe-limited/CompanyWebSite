		<h4>General Features</h4>
		<div>

			<p>
				ELTAŞ strengths are unique engineering and design features and flexibility to meet all the customer requirements.
				<br />Every transformer is designed according to its required specification and its application.
			</p>

			<p>
				The following activities are used to ensure reliability of product:
				<br />Design optimization, considering of design relation to labor and material costs, loss evaluation and noise level, distribution of voltage stresses under impulse lightning and switching surge conditions, behavior during short circuit conditions, both transient electrodynamics and continuous thermal withstand analysis of those areas where high electrical stresses can occur, and optimization of the insulation structure design, calculation of stray losses and thermal effects.
			</p>

		<h4>Specifications</h4>
		<div>
			<p>
				<b>Core</b>
				<br />Our transformer are designed according to “ core type” design. Slitting and cutting of core is done “ in house”. Core are manufactured from high quality standards also high quality cold – rolled grain oriented silicon steel laminations, which are coated with carlite.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Winding</b>
				<br />All winding are of the circular type, since this type has the highest resistance against short circuits. Depending on the specific design criteria, layer, helical, disc, partly interleaved or fully interleaved winding are also used.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Tank</b>
				<br />Tank design is competely done by 3-D CAD on computer, which determines the optimum size and the number and location of needed supports, which makes handling, assembely and instalation easier for customer.

		<h4>Accessories</h4>
		<div>
			<p>
				The following accessories are mainly used to protect transformers:
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>1. Oil Level Indicator</b>
				<br>Magnetic oil level gauges are used in order to follow and to control the oil level in the conservator of transformers. Oil level indicators give alarm and tripping signals in case of sudden changes of the oil level.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>2. Air Dehumidifier</b>
				<br>Air dehumidifier are utilized for transformers with oil conservator. It is connected to the oil conservator. Via silicagel, it removes moisture and dust coming into the conservator. The amount of  Silicagel depends on the amount of oil inside the transformer.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>3. Oil Thermometer</b>
				<br>Oil thermometers, which are located in thermometer pockets and welded on the top of  the cover or on the side of the tank, follow and control the maximum temperature of the oil. It is available with maximum pointer, without electrical contact or with single or double electrical contact. If the temperature exceeds the estimated values, thermometers with contact give alarm or tripping signals.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>4. Buchholz ( Gas Collecting and Alarm) Relay</b>
				<br>The Buchholz-Relay collects the gasses which are formed by discharges or arcs with low or high intensity inside of the transformer. It used for transformers with conservator. The relay can be with single or double contact. If certain amount of gas is collected on the Buchholz-Relay, both the alarm and tripping signals are activated. Moreover, Buchholz-Relay sends out an alarm signal in low level of oil. The Buchholz-Relay detects failures like overheating and prevents an increase of failure by signalling.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>5. Pressure Relief Device</b>
				<br>Even though hermetic protection relay is used in transformers, pressure relief device is used additionally. It helps to cover the pressure that expands inside of the transformer.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>6.Hermetic Protection Relay</b>
				<br>Hermetically sealed transformers equal and greater than 630 kVA are equipped with a Hermetic Protection Relay. It consists the functions of Oil Level Indicator, Temperature Indicator, Buchholz-Relay as well as Pressure Relay.
			</p>

			<p>Besides, upon customer’s request, special accessories such as winding thermometer, digital thermometer, gas collecting unit can be used  for  oil immersed power transformers.</p>
