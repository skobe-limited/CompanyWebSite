		<h4>General Features</h4>
		<div>

			<p>
				<b>Earthing Transformers</b>
				<br />Earthing transformers are used to provide a ground connection by creating a neutral point to three phase wye or delta connection system. Besides earthing purpose, these transformers  can be provided with an auxiliary winding for supplying energy requirements of local consumers. ZN connection group is used  only for the purpose of grounding. If an auxiliary winding is requested, these transformers can be designed with "ZNyn" or "YNd" vector groups . According to the  fault current and fault current duration  request of the customer, design can be done.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Converter Transformers</b>
				<br />Converter transformers are special type transformers and are used for feeding converters. According to the customer requirements, these transformers can be manufactured as  6-12-18-24-36-48 pulse. If it is requested, an electrostatic shield is placed between primary and secondary windings. Also, grid harmonic values specified by the customer are taken into account.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Autotransformers</b>
				<br />In autotransformers, a part of or entire primary winding is used as secondary winding and both of the windings are exposed to same magnetic field. Generally, these transformers are used for starting asynchronous motors or for compensating the voltage drops occuring in the transmission and disribution networks and lines.
				<br /><br />The advantages of autotransformers in proportion to two winding transformers:
				<ul>
					<li>Lightweight and the cost is inexpensive.</li>
					<li>Iron and copper losses are less.</li>
					<li>Efficiency is high.</li>
					<li>Regulation is good.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>


			<p>
				<b>Shunt Reactors</b>
				<br />Shunt reactors are used to compensate capacitive load created by the long energy transmission and distribution cables, by creating an inductive load. These transformers also improve the quality and efficiency of the energy grid by preventing excessive voltages. According to the customer requirements, it can be designed with voltage stages and/or power stages.
