		<p>Distribution transformers are used to decrease the medium voltage (3.3 -36 kV ) to low voltage level (≤ 1000 V ) . ELTAŞ A.Ş. manufactures oil immersed transformers from 25 kVA&nbsp; to&nbsp; 5000 kVA .</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Distribution transformers can be ordered as single phase or three phase units.</li>
			<li>ELTAŞ A.Ş. uses inhibited or uninhibited mineral oil in its productions. If requested,non-flammable fluids can be used as well.</li>
			<li>Distribution transformers are produced with ONAN ( Oil -Natural Air -Natural ) or ONAF ( Oil -Natural Air -Forced ) cooling systems.</li>
			<li>Distribution transformers are manufactured as open to atmosphere with conservator, sealed to atmosphere or hermetically sealed with gas cushion.</li>
			<li>Distribution transformers are provided with off-load tap changers or on-load tap changers.</li>
			<li>Distribution transformers can be manufactured with cable box or protection box.</li>
			<li>Distribution transformers are manufactured with bushings with ceramic insulators or with resin type plug-in bushings.</li>
		</ul>
