		<h3>Installation and Initial Offloading</h3>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-6">
				Aydas Transformer Services Limited field technicians have expertise on initial offloading in the following operations:

				<ul>
					<li>Overseeing the offloading from the haulage vehicle to final positioning to the transformer plinth</li>
					<li>Analysing the impact recorder data and performing core insulation resistance measurement</li>
					<li>Positioning anti- vibration pads (if applicable)</li>
					<li>Recording (video- reporting) the complete process</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Our Technicians coordinate and locate all ancillary deliveries to ensure safe operation of cranes/PUWER before commencing pre-assembly checks.
				</p>
				<p>
					Installation activities shall be performed in accordance with the risk assessment/method of statement (RAMS) and strictly following the principle contractor project safety instructions. Safety is always the priority to reduce and mitigate the possible risks at site. Depending upon the site conditions, our experts always monitor the risks to ensure safe place to work for themselves and others.
				</p>
				<p>
					Assembling conservators, radiators, cooler banks, cooling fans, pipework, turrets and bushings, current transformers, OLTC, ancillary components, kiosks, wiring, vacuum and oil filling are all part of our field technician duty.

				Vacuuming is the key process to remove the moisture out of the tank and dry the transformer insulation to maintain a longer lifetime.
				<p>Pulling the full vacuum on the empty transformer tank is caused conversion of the water to vapor at a lower temperature under low pressure. The vapour is extracted out of the transformer thru the vacuum pump system.</p>
				<p>There are several techniques to determine the moisture level of the insulation including the PIPER chart method and Dew Point method. The acceptable moisture content by volume throughout the industry is 0.5 percent for a new unit and 0.65 percent for an older unit.</p>
				<p>After achieving the desired moisture level, then the oil can be filled to the transformer under vacuum.</p>
				<p>Vacuuming and oil filling activities shall monitor very closely by the field technicians. Our field service team are skilled to supervise the oil plant contractors to make sure the exact procedure is followed very carefully. Our team take the oil samples for oil analysis and Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) after oil filling process to have a reference data of the oil before energization in case of fault diagnostics.</p>
