					Aydas Transformer Services Limited provides reliable service with all aspects of maintenance and testing and makes use of state-of-the-art tools and techniques for evaluating transformer condition.
				</p>
				<h3>Reasons for Maintenance, Condition and Life Assessment</h3>
				<p>For providing reliable electrical energy, it is very necessary to have highly reliable associated electrical equipment. The transformer, being a key element in the transmission and distribution of electrical energy, improving its reliability is of utmost importance. Hence, it is, all the more essential, to employ continuous monitoring techniques and on-site diagnostics followed by quality maintenance for having the trouble-free and reliable operation with minimum outages. While on-line diagnostic systems and computerized testing methods are very helpful, they are not a substitute for sound engineering judgment and expertise.</p>

				<h3>Main Assessment areas</h3>
				<p>
					Following are the major components, which have a direct bearing on the reliability of the transformers’ :
				</p>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>Winding and electrical circuit,</li>
						<li>Core and clamping structure,</li>
						<li>Bushings and external connections,</li>
						<li>Tap chargers,</li>
						<li>Coolers and cooling medium,</li>
						<li>Control and supervisory equipment</li>
					</ul>

		<h3>Why it is necessary to maintaining the Transformers?</h3>

		<p>As transformer aging, their insulation strength can degrade to the point that they cannot withstand system events such as short -circuit faults or transient overvoltage.</p>

		<h3>
			“To prevent failures and to maintain transformers in good operation condition it is very essential to conduct maintenance plans with regular testing.”
		</h3>
		<h3>
			Reasons for Maintenance:
		</h3>
		<p>

			<ul>
				<li>Thermal effects (Overload, overheating, ambient conditions)</li>
				<li>Aging (Degradation of insulation on active part, Moisture, contamination, leakages)</li>
				<li>Mechanical effects (Transportation damage, short-circuit stresses, seismic activity)</li>
				<li>Electrical effects (Lightening, switching surges, overvoltages and short circuits in the electrical network)</li>
				<li>Weak point in the transformer design</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Maintenance Actions Should be Driven by “Transformer Condition”</h2>

		<h3>Condition monitoring and Life Assesment</h3>
		<p>Transformer failure can have a significant economic impact due to long lead times in procurement, manufacturing, and installation in addition to high equipment cost. Determining the present condition of a power transformer is an essential step in analysing the risk of failure and making short-term decisions regarding operation and maintenance activities.</p>

		<p>Aydas Transformer Services Limited are able to evaluate the condition of the power transformers and implement the transformer- based condition monitoring method by using existing body of the knowledge and technologies in order to manage and extend the life of transformers, to reduce failures and to produce a reliable and cost-effective system.</p>

		<h3>Transformer Diagnostics Techniques</h3>
		<p>Several transformer diagnostic techniques are used by Aydas Transformer Services Limited on-site to determine the transformer life cycle and failure risk. They can be grouped into, <b>“offline test”</b> and <b>“online tests”</b> which are based on IEC and IEEE standards.</p>
